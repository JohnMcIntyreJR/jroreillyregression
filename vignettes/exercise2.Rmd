## Model Assessment

1. Load the James Bond data set

```{r}
library(jroreillyregression)
data(bond)
head(bond)
```

2. Create a `trainControl` object to set up for cross validation estimates of test error of a model

```{r,message = FALSE}
library(caret)
tc = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)
```


3. Train a model using `Alcohol_Units` and `Relationships` to predict number of kills using the `train` function from `caret` to estimate test error

```{r}
m = train(Kills~Alcohol_Units + Relationships, data = bond, method = "lm")
```


4. Fit a new model that also includes `Nationality` as a predictor. Does this improve the predictive ability of the model?

5. If you have time, create bootstrapped estimates of the regression coefficients to determine the variance of them.
